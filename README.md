FloaterBall
===============

A physics-based collection game where you control a white ball that floats around the canvas with momentum-based movement. The core objective is to collect as many squares as 
possible within a time limit while navigating through increasingly challenging levels.


How to Play
----

Arrow Keys: Move the ball in any direction
Shift: Brake/stop movement
Spacebar: Continue to next level after completion

Scoring System
----

Gray squares: 1 point each (main collectibles)
Purple squares: 10 bonus points (appear after 5 seconds in level 2+)
Green squares: 5 points each (1-3 spawn in level 2+)
Orange squares: Powerup that doubles ball size temporarily
Red squares: Game over if collected (appear on even levels 2+)

Progression
----

50 levels total, each with decreasing time limits and increasing obstacles

Win
----

Complete level by collecting at least one square before time runs out.
Lose Conditions: Run out of time with zero points collected, or touch a red square (a.k.a the forbidden fruit)
